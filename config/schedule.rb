# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron before proceeding.

# Example:
#
# set :output, "/path/to/my/cron_log.log"
#
# every 2.hours do
#   command "/usr/bin/some_great_command"
#   runner "MyModel.some_method"
#   rake "some:great:rake:task"
# end
#
# every 4.days do
#   runner "AnotherModel.prune_old_records"
# end

# adds ">> /path/to/file.log 2>&1" to all commands
set :output, 'log/cron.log'

env :PATH, ENV['PATH'] # Sets path to user path so cron job can find ruby
